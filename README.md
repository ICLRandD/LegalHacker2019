# Legal Hackers Annual Summit 2019 (Brooklyn, NYC)

This repository contains materials for the Open Legal Data Forum at the Legal Hacker 2019 (September 2019 + Brooklyn, NYC)

We've made a little Jupyter Notebook that takes a hastily thrown-together spin through doing NLP with legal materials (in this case, a subset of the data made available under Harvard LIL's Caselaw Access Project.

If you just want to take a quick read of the notebook and avoid the hullabaloo of creating a virtual environment and running the notebook locally, we've saved the executed output of the notebook here: https://legalhackers19.s3.amazonaws.com/Legal_Hackers_2019.html

If you would instead like to run the notebook on your own machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo and `cd LegalHackers2019`
2. Create a virtual enviroment `python3 -m venv lh2019`
3. Activate the virtual environment `source lh2019/bin/activate`
4. Install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run Jupyter `jupyter-lab`
